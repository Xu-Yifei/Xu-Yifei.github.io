One of my favorite computer games is osu! (exclamation mark included) It&amp;rsquo;s a free rhythm game where the player&amp;rsquo;s goal is to click a bunch of circles that appear on the screen to the beat of a song. Songs are referred to as &amp;ldquo;beatmaps,&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;maps&amp;rdquo; for short.
Over time, something I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed is that there isn&amp;rsquo;t a really great way to share multiple beatmaps with your friends. Say you&amp;rsquo;ve found a few beatmaps that you really like, and you want your friend to try playing them.</description>
