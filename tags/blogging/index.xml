      <description>Back in early 2016, I created a Tumblr account because God knows why. Aha, actually it&amp;rsquo;s because I sorta wanted to exercise my writing skills somewhere outside of school, and blogging seemed like a cool way to achieve that. Part of me actually enjoyed writing because it was a nice way to sort out some thoughts in my head, and overall, it was just a peaceful experience.
At the time, I thought my posts were pretty cool.</description>
