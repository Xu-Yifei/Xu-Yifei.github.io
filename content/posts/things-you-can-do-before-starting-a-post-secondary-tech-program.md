Disclaimer: Everyone's first year uni experiences will be a bit different

Ok, so you're about to be a super cool üë®‚Äçüíª COMPUTER ENGINEER/SOFTWARE ENGINEER/COMPUTER SCIENCE STUDENT üë©‚Äçüíª!!! The first year of university/college is a pretty huge slap in the face, especially if you're living away from home for the first time in a while. Most of those habits you learned in highschool... out the window. It's a new environment with new demands, and a lot of the professors aren't too scared of kicking students down the stairs (metaphorically). If anyone else has told you otherwise, then they may also be telling a valid truth based on their own experiences which are no more valid/invalid than mine.

Before university/college actually starts, there are some things you can do to make your life easier when shit hits the fan. Pretty much everyone will struggle, but you can limit the amount of things you struggle on.

## Learn a bit of C or C++

Every computer-something student I know has taken at least one course that uses either C or C++. However, the challenges in those courses usually aren't focused on actual code-writing. It's moreso understanding the various programming or mathematic concepts that professors care about the most. That said, writing good code is still an essential skill if want your life to be a bit easier in those courses. Ideally, you'll want to focus most of your time in class working on understanding concepts and ideas, not implementations. 

Btw you might end up having to work on coding labs that take at least 24 hours of concerted effort to finish. Not getting stuck on how to write code will hopefully reduce that number by a little bit.

If you're able to take a programming course in high school, definitely take it. They should teach all of the fundamentals that'll get you started on the right feet in your university programming courses. If you aren't able to study a bit of programming in school, then I would recommend figuring out how to develop a calculator console app. This should expose you to the simplest tools and features of the language that you'll be using over and over again, maybe for the rest of your career ;')

## Draft up a resume

This is especially important if you plan on enrolling in a co-op program. Your resume doesn't have to even look good yet. The point is to start recalling things you've done in high school that might be valuable to show to your potential employers. As time goes on, it's easy to forget those small things you did that helped you gain skills that translate well into the workplace. 

Many students choose to work on side projects before beginning their first uni semester. It's definitely a plus to have on your resume, especially if your first co-op semester is in your first year, but it isn't an absolute requirement. All-year-long, universities host these cool competitions called "hackathons"! Essentially, you visit a venue for anywhere between 6-48 hours, and you code up some type of software to show off. The projects you work on at a hackathon can also be added to a resume. Don't worry if the code is bad, the point is to try something new!

## Uhhhhhhh some other stuff

Yeah I'll update this section if there is anything else to do.

Tbh tho you really don't want to overwork yourself in the summer after Grade 12. It's your last "guaranteed free" summer, so just enjoy your time. You might think that it'd be a waste of time not to prepare more for university, but one of the best things you can do is give your brain some time to rest.
