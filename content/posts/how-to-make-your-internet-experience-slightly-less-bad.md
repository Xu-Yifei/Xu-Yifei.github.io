The Internet can kinda suck at times. Here are some ways to make it suck less!

## ✦ Use different passwords with a password manager ✦

Basically, you want to make it so that removing one brick doesn't collapse the whole structure.

If you like to make accounts for every different website you visit, you're increasing your digital footprint, which in turn makes it easier for a malicious hacker to access all of your very cool and valuable personal data. The safest way to protect yourself from this is to just never make any accounts for any website, but that would make it kinda difficult for you to actually do anything on the Internet.

So you should continue making accounts, but with the help of a 𝕡𝕒𝕤𝕤𝕨𝕠𝕣𝕕 𝕞𝕒𝕟𝕒𝕘𝕖𝕣, since remembering things is hard.

The general idea is that you have this one central repository that stores each and every single one of your passwords. BUT WAIT that sounds kind of dangerous doesn't it? If you store all of your valuables in the garage and then it explodes, everything's gone!!! And that would be correct, which is why I think it's a bad idea to store "essential" passwords in a password manager.

Just like in real life, you (probably) keep your wallet, keys, and phone close to you, then store all of the extra stuff that isn't nearly as essential to your livelihood in the garage. 

Things like your primary email, and bank account passwords should be unique, secure strings that are hard to guess even for a computer. The best passwords are strings like `6sWt,6h*9AT^Hh?i"NSR` or `kAhlQ@Eq;%SV@:PoUvDe`, but these are pretty hard to remember as a normal person. So, you can consider using memorable words or numbers with a little bit of extra spiciness. `++Sush1_i5_THE_BEST++` or `<html>727m0ng00se727</html>` are likely just as hard to guess for a computer, but are somewhat more memorable than some random concatenation of symbols.
