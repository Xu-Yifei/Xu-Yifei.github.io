Hi! I'm Yifei. 

![cute thing I drew](https://imgur.com/ejmxmvk.png#feiri)

I'm a second-year computer engineering student at the University of Waterloo. At the moment, I'm trying to experience as wide a variety of software-related experiences as I can. I'm learning more about the world of technology every week, and I want to learn as much as I can.

I love playing rhythm games, arts and graphic design, and learning about anything that seems cool.
